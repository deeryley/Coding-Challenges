# Coding Challanges

In this repo I will upload my solutions on coding problems

<h2>1. centuryFromYear <h2>
Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

Example
For year = 1905, the output should be
solution(year) = 20;
For year = 1700, the output should be
solution(year) = 17.

<h2>2. checkPalindrome</h2>
Given the string, check if it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, sentence, verse, or even number that reads the same backward or forward.

Example

For inputString = "aabaa", the output should be
solution(inputString) = true;
For inputString = "abac", the output should be
solution(inputString) = false;
For inputString = "a", the output should be
solution(inputString) = true.

<h2>3. adjacentElementsProduct</h2>
Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.

Example

For inputArray = [3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3], the output should be
solution(inputArray) = 21.

7 and 3 produce the largest product.
